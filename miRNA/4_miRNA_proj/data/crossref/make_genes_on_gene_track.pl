# this script will make a candidate gene list for DE 
# genes in all 3 cell types.  cCTBs express the least, 
# so all of these will be in the list. 

# or maybe just the genes that have annotated targets. 
# go with this one.  Genes w/ annotated targets. Otherwise
# that's you're plotting > 1000 genes
